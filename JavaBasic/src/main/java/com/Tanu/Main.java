             // which of integer type
          // now you might get a question what are this datatypes
          // so datatype reprsent the data which you want to store

        // there are types of datatypes
       // Primitive data types - includes byte , short , int , long , float , double , boolean and char.


        // Non-primitive data types - such as String , Arrays and Classes
        // what are primitive data types and non primetive data type
       // Non-primitive data types in Java are not predefined. They are created by the programmer.
        // Non-primitive data types are also called 'reference variables' or 'object references' as they reference a memory location where data is stored.
        // Some of the examples of non-primitive types include strings, arrays, and classes.


         // for taking Input we use Scanner class
